abstract: When I was a 9 year old boy, I liked to be a Programmer so I started playing games and understood the mechanisms used by the games, when I turned 13  I started to modify the source codes of various such as Minecraft, GTA SA and many others. Now, when I am 14 years old I started to watch tutorials from Internet on C# and used Unity3D as my IDE to understand the statements and method visually instead of sightless, later I made 6 different kinds of games but I deleted them becuase I just wanted to understand the physics and mechanisms made by the games, so I learnt the basic and easiest script in the C# and thought that it would be a great idea to make my own website to teach others. As you have seen on my Skills menu that I only have 20% of experience in C# because I just started learning C# a week ago.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: How I got interested in C#.
